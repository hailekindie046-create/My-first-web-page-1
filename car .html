<h1>Trafic accident</h1>
<p>Traffic accidents are very dangerous because they can cause serious injuries and even death. When vehicles 
    collide, the impact can harm drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. Accidents also lead to emotional pain and 
    financial problems for those involved. Many accidents happen because of careless driving, speeding, or not
     following traffic rules. That’s why it’s important to always drive safely, pay attention, and respect other people
      on the road to prevent these dangerous situations.
